# Simple Neural Network for Logical "AND" Operation

This Python script demonstrates a basic neural network implementation for solving the logical "AND" operation. It uses a single neuron with sigmoid activation to make predictions. The goal is to train the neural network to approximate the "AND" operation, and it can be easily modified to demonstrate other logical operations like "OR."

## Dataset

Two datasets are provided as comments in the code:

1. "AND" Dataset: This dataset consists of input pairs (x1, x2) and their corresponding output (y), following the "AND" logical operation.
   
2. "OR" Dataset: This dataset can be used to demonstrate the "OR" logical operation, and it is provided as a commented alternative.

You can choose the dataset you want to use by uncommenting the corresponding lines in the code.

## Neural Network Model

The neural network consists of a single neuron with sigmoid activation. It is trained to learn the relationship between input values (x1, x2) and the output (y) using gradient descent optimization.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Open the Python script in a code editor or IDE.

3. Choose the dataset you want to use by uncommenting the appropriate lines.

4. Run the script.

## Training and Testing

The script will train the neural network using the chosen dataset and print the trained model's predictions for the training data. You can monitor the training progress by uncommenting the print statements in the code.

Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different datasets to understand basic neural network concepts and their application in solving logical operations.
